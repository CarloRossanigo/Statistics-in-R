#Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of the fat dataset with the objective of identifying key variables that predict Body Mass Index (BMI) and the likelihood of being overweight. Specifically, the analysis explores variables that are not collinear with BMI (adipos) and evaluates their significance in predicting BMI and the condition of being overweight.
