# Statistics-in-R
This repository contains a project developed during my university course in the Statistical Laboratory (3 ECTS), performed in R, along with a PowerPoint presentation. The project analyzes the fat dataset to identify key predictors of BMI and overweight, using linear and logistic regressions, and classification trees.
